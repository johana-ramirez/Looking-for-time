# Project 01 - Timepiece
Johana Ramirez - Looking for Time

## Interpretation Guide
- Creatures: the comet-like shapes held inside the star 
- Star: the outer shape that holds the creatures 

### How to read my Timepiece:
- Minutes: the current minute is represented by the star that holds the creatures. 
The number of points the star has represents the minute. For example, the minute 0 
is represented with a circle and the minute 59 is represented by 59 outer points. 
(Disclaimer: the shapes for minute 1 is a rectangle because I have not implemented a teardrop shape yet)

- Seconds: Each creature represents the current second. A new creature is added as a seconds increases. 
(Disclaimer: some creatures escape the star due to a bug)

### Meaning behind my Timepiece:
- For this Timepiece, I thought about how time can sometimes feel fast or slow. In paticular, I wanted to 
showcase the hastiness of time, that feeling you get when you are "running" out of time. I used the 
creatures to represent this feeling as they wander around randomly and seem a bit lost. As there are more
creatures, things become more chaotic, when you are nearing the end of a minute, when time is "running out". 
I also choose the star to represent the minutes because I imagine this taking place in space. Space feels 
far away similar to how time feels like its running away.
